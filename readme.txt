Dependencies are on;
   - Copas
   - LuaSocket
   - CopasTimer
   - Date

IMPORTANT:
The current release (1.1.6) of Copas will not work becasue it does not support UDP.
You should download the HEAD revision from the github repo, or use my version at https://github.com/Tieske/copas

If you require support, please visit http://xplproject.org.uk
